# Data Preparation 

- use kaggle api to get the data 
- extract it 


- The same flow as from Facial emotions detection for the importing of data
- normalizing



# Modeling  :


```
- CONV2D
  maxpooling

and using GlobalAveragepooling2d layer for flattening
then nn layers


```

This docx is pretty short 
see the facial emotion detection docx


In this , we are doing this as special :

using model checkpointers
- early stopping : for stopping if there is same loss and accuracy  alot fo time


THere is also code to test out our model , so do check it out , its the most fun part

then legend plot , pretty good ngl
